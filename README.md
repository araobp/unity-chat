# Salesforce Live Chat integration with Unity

(Work in progress, very experimental project)

## Config.cs

"Config.cs" is not included in this repo for security/privacy reasons. Create "Config.cs" with the following constants:

```
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class Config : MonoBehaviour
{
    public const string BASE_URL = "...";
    public const string ORGANIZATION_ID = "...";
            :
}
```
